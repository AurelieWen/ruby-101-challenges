## Background

An Acronym is a word formed as an abbreviation from the initial letters of words in a phrase.

## Specs

- Implement a Ruby method `acronymize` that builds an acronym for a given sentence
- This method should take one argument (sentence), a `String`, and return another `String` representing the resulting acronym
- The resulting acronmym should be all caps
- It should not be affected by words already capitalized

`acronymize("as soon as possible")` should return `"ASAP"`

`acronymize("Not Safe for Work")` should return `"NSFW"`

## Key Learning Points

- `String` methods
- `return` statement in methods
- Loops
