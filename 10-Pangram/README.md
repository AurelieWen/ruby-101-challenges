## Background

A Pangram is a sentence that contains every word of the alphabet.

## Specs

- Implement a Ruby method `pangram?` that checks if a given sentence is a pangram
- This method should take one argument (sentence), a `String`, and return a `Boolean` (true of false), telling us if the given sentence is a pangram or not
- It should not be affected by capital letters

`pangram?("the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog")` should return `true`

`pangram?("le wagon is a coding school")` should return `false`

## Key Learning Points

- `String` methods
- Predicate methods (returning a `Boolean`)
- Loops
- Dealing with capital letters
