## Specs

- Implement a ruby method that returns an `Array` of 2 `arrays` of letters included between a couple of letters. The first one must contain vowels whereas the second one must contain consonants.

`vowels_and_consonants('h', 'k')` should return: `[['i'], ['h', 'j', 'k']]`

`vowels_and_consonants('j', 'k')` should return: `[[], [j', 'k']]`

## Key Learning Points

- `Array` methods
- `Range` methods
- `Array` CRUD
- `return` statement in methods
