## Specs

- Implement a ruby method that returns an `Array` of [billboard top 3 artists](http://www.billboard.com/charts/artist-100) with your favorite artist in first position!
- The method should take an `Array` of 3 top artists and your favorite artist as a `String` in parameters.

`favorite_artists(["Niall Horan", "Pink", "Ed Sheeran"], "Mc Solaar")` should return:

`["Mc Solaar", "Niall Horan", "Pink"]`

## Key Learning Points

- `Array` CRUD
- `return` statement in methods
