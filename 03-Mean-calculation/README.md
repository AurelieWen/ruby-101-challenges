## Specs

- Implement a ruby method `#mean` that returns the exact mean between to numbers.

`mean(4, 6)` should return a `Float`

`mean(2, 3)` should return `2.5`

`mean(2.5, 3)` should return `2.75`

## Key Learning Points

- `Integer` methods
- `Variable` assignment
- `Float` transformation
- `return` statement in methods
