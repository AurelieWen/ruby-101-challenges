## Specs

- Implement a Ruby method `max` that finds the maximum/highest number between two numbers
- This method should take two arguments (a, b), both `Fixnums`, and **return** another `Fixnum`, the highest number.

`max(3, 9)` should return `9`

`max(5, 1)` should return `5`

Note: you can run `rake` in the **Terminal** to test your code or run the ruby file using `ruby lib/max.rb`, but don't forget to call and `puts` what returns from your method when you call it

## Key Learning Points

- Methods
- Conditionals
- Method Parameters vs. Arguments
